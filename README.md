# Map Background



The python program creates a black and grey map in a 16:9 aspect ratio of paris. The location can be changed by inputing corrdinates of another place, but for right now it has a preset location

The program takes quite a long time to execute because it interacts with an external source to pull the map info, it is also very high resolution, so it takes a while to render and crop.

At some point I will implement the following features:
- Location selection
- Aspect ratio selection
- Color selection
- Range selection
- DPI selection
- Possibly a way to also highlight water features
